Sharmeen, a little girl learned C programming recently. She can print anything in this programming language. Can you do the same as Sharmeen?

<b>Input</b>
There is no input for this problem.

<b>Output</b>
Just output ‘Print \C Programming’ without quotes.




The problem seems to be asking us to simply print a string "Print \C Programming" without any input or processing. We can start by thinking about how to print a string in C++.

Since we don't need to read any input, we can directly use the `std::cout` statement to print the required string. However, we need to make sure that the backslash character in the string is properly escaped.

Let's think about how to escape the backslash character in C++. We can use another backslash to escape it, so the correct string to print would be "Print \\C Programming".

Now, let's think about the code structure. We can start with a simple `main` function and use `std::cout` to print the string. We don't need any headers or namespaces other than `iostream`.





#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Print \\C Programming" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
