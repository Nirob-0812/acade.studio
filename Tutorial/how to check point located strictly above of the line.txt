How to check a certain point \(p\) is located strictly above the line \(L\)?
Compute the cross product of vectors \( \vec{u} = L.x - p \) and \( \vec{v} = L.y - p \) to determine the orientation of these vectors.
If the cross product is positive, it means the angle between \( \vec{u} \) and \( \vec{v} \) (traversed in a counter-clockwise direction) is less than 180 degrees.
This indicates that point \( p \) is indeed above the line when moving from \( L.x \) to \( L.y \).
