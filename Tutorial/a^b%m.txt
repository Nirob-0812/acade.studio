We can calculate \(a ^ b\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using exponentiation by squaring. 
Exponentiation by squaring is a method for fast computation of powers in modular arithmetic. It is based on the fact that \(x^{2n} = (x^n)^2\) and \(x^{2n+1} = x \cdot (x^n)^2\).
We can use this method to calculate \(a ^ b\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) in \(O(\log N)\) time.
